##Hi friend!
###I want to show you my JavaScript game named by me- Titanic!

It's kind of hanging-man game, where you have to find the correct password in 9 attempts. If you will not do this-the 
Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio on board will sink! 
#####Save Leonardo!
You've got 3 categories: music, movies and proverbs. 40 passwords each category, so in the base are 120 passwords, which
i chosen, so this game is a little difficult!

Thanks to Miroslaw Zelent, great blogger/vlogger. I didn't know what to do to learn better JS, your idea about hanging-man
 game was awesome.
